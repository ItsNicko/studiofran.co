          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Nicko, a 17-year-old technologist, creative builder, and
            business thinker. I'm in FBLA, went to Nationals in 2025, and I
            spend my time building weird stuff: ESP32 bots, modded McDonald's
            toys, ChatGPT clones, and smart circuits. I believe in hacking
            things open, building from scratch, and marketing the future.
          </p>

          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>
            I started with LEGO and math. Nothing deep just liked how it felt to
            build something and solve problems. Nobody pushed me to do it. I
            just wanted to make something bigger than me. At one point I told
            people I wanted to work at NASA, not because I understood what that
            meant, but because I wanted to be around big ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was 11, I got curious about how websites worked. My school
            blocked right-click and inspect element, so I Googled my way into
            <code>view-source://</code>. It felt like peeking behind the
            curtain. That was my first real “hack”; not illegal, just curiosity
            paired with stubbornness.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 12, I made a spacebar clicker using JavaScript. It saved your
            score and everything. I threw it up on a free domain from Freenom
            and shared it with friends. Was it dumb? Yeah. But it worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2022, I made a cookie-clicker-style game. But mine had a whole
            material system: wood → stone → iron → steel → diamonds → rubies.
            The upgrades followed that logic too from axe, wood farm, pickaxe, stone
            miner. I didn't look up a tutorial there was non but there were
            tutorials teaching diffent parts of the puzzle. I wanted to build it
            all myself and figure out how logic stacked on top of logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            That same year, I found out about AI. I didn't just want to use
            ChatGPT. I wanted to build my own. I started learning Python and
            built a console-based chatbot using the OpenAI API. It could only
            answer one question and forgot everything after. From there, I made
            a multi-question version using Flask and chat completions. It broke
            constantly. The API would timeout, memory would leak, frontend
            wouldn't update, but I kept pushing until it worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2023, I got into home labbing. The school's computers didn't have
            the power I was seeking, so I used RealVNC to remote into my PC at
            home. It worked, but was slow. So I got smarter. I hooked up a
            Raspberry Pi with a proxy to the school network, which let me
            securely route traffic to my Chromebook. Nothing shady just wanted
            to access tools the school didn't have.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2024, I found ChatGLM-6B, a Chinese open-source LLM that mimicked
            OpenAI's API format. Cheaper, local, and actually decent. I started
            running it on my own server, experimenting with how far I could push
            it on a budget.
          </p>
          <p>
            That year I also started circuit bending. Cheap toys would break, so
            I'd open them up, rewire them, add FX chips, and turn them into
            something new. Then came the ESP32 experiments—sensors, buttons,
            microcontrollers all stitched into small AI dashboards.

          <h2>Why I Do This</h2>
          <p>
            I like knowing how things work and then making them do things they
            weren't designed to do. I don't come from a long list of engineers
            or coders. I just like figuring things out, even when they fight
            back.
