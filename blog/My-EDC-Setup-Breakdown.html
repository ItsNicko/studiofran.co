  <h2>üéí What I Actually Use Every Day (My EDC + Setup Breakdown)</h2>
  <p>I overthink gear. Not because I want the nicest stuff - I just don't want things that slow me down or feel off. Everything here is something I've picked apart, tested, and kept because it works for how I think, build, and move.</p>

  <h2>üíª Laptop: Dell XPS 16 9640</h2>
  <p>I needed something powerful enough to handle AI, coding, 20 Chrome tabs, and maybe a little Unreal. But also clean. XPS gives me MacBook energy but with Windows and ports.</p>
  <p>I picked the 16 because I don't like cramped screens. Trackpad's actually usable (rare on Windows).</p>
  <p>Only complaint: it's kinda heavy, but I knew what I signed up for. This is my mobile command center. I don't baby it - it's a tool.</p>

  <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Build: RTX 3060 / Ryzen 5 6800 / 16GB RAM / 2TB</h2>
  <p>This one's my fault - I built it during a burnout weekend just to feel productive.</p>
  <p>3060 is the sweet spot: strong enough for deep learning and games, but doesn't fry my wallet.</p>
  <p>6800 because I wanted a snappy CPU but didn't care about bragging rights.</p>
  <p>2TB because I hoard files, datasets, and backups like it's 1999.</p>
  <p>I could've gone 32GB RAM, but I haven't maxed 16 yet. If I do, I'll upgrade. I buy what I need when I need it.</p>

  <h2>üß† Homelab: HP EliteDesk G5</h2>
  <p>I7-8900 / 16GB / 2TB NVMe</p>
  <p>This one's criminally underrated. Got it cheap, runs cool, and does everything quietly in the corner.</p>
  <p>Runs a custom OS I built off Arch. Yeah, I made my life harder on purpose.</p>
  <p>I use it for file storage, SSH access, containers, and weird Linux projects.</p>
  <p>It's small enough to hide but important enough I panic when the power flickers.</p>
  <p>Might grab another and cluster them. More power never hurts.</p>

  <h2>üéí Bag: North Face Surge</h2>
  <p>It's not flashy, but it holds everything. I tried more ‚Äúminimal‚Äù bags. They annoyed me.</p>
  <p>This has compartments where I want them, and I can throw it on the floor without caring.</p>

  <h2>‚úèÔ∏è Pens, Tools & Notebooks</h2>
  <p><strong>Rotring 600:</strong> I bought this because I wanted a pencil that felt like a weapon. And it is. Metal, weighty, makes me write slower in a good way.</p>
  <p><strong>Pentel P205:</strong> My fast pencil. When I'm sketching ideas or doing math, I don't want to be precise. I want to be quick.</p>
  <p><strong>Mintra Notebook (white):</strong> Simple. Durable. I tried fancy notebooks but hated how stiff and dark they felt. This one lets me scribble and move on.</p>
  <p><strong>General Tools Precision Set (28-piece):</strong> You never realize how often stuff breaks until you carry a screwdriver. I fix everything I can. It's satisfying.</p>
  <p><strong>HYTO Screwdriver:</strong> Daily carry screwdriver can't be carring a set on me this one is pocketable.</p>
  <p><strong>Pinecil by PINE64:</strong> Great for soldering - quickly heats up, super fast, and its magnetic stand holds it securely. You don't know how many times I've burned myself with other irons.</p>

  <h2>üíæ Storage: Silicon Power 1TB w/ Enclosure</h2>
  <p>Picked this one for two reasons: cheap but not trash, and it doesn't overheat after 10 mins.</p>
  <p>It's my emergency drive. Backup, bootable OS, or sneakernet if Wi-Fi dies.</p>

  <h2>üéß iPhone 12 + AirPods Pro 2</h2>
  <p>iPhone 12 still holds up. Camera's solid, screen's fine, no reason to upgrade (yet).</p>
  <p>AirPods Pro 2 = lifesavers. Noise canceling, fast pairing, decent mic. They're not ‚Äúaudiophile,‚Äù but I'm not trying to mix an album on the train.</p>
  <p>Sony MDR-EX14 school banned bluetooth devices, wanted somthing better than airpods but still wired.</p>

  <h2>ü™õ Custom Google Mini (ESP32 Mod)</h2>
  <p>This was a dumb project that ended up teaching me a lot.</p>
  <p>Took apart a Google Mini, replaced the board with an ESP32.</p>
  <p>Now it runs local voice commands + some automations I set up. It's not about practicality. It's about being curious.</p>

  <h2>üé∏ Fender Jazz Bass</h2>
  <p>Not part of my workflow, but part of my mental health.</p>
  <p>When I can't think straight or I'm fried from code, I just play. It's analog. It's slow. It doesn't beep or ping or demand anything. That matters.</p>

  <h2>üñ® EcoTank Printer/Scanner</h2>
  <p>I don't print often, but when I do, I don't want to deal with ink drama. This one works. That's all I ask.</p>

  <h2>‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting & Dev Tools</h2>
  <p>I use Cloudflare Pages to host most of my static sites - fast, secure, and no nonsense.</p>
  <p>For custom domain emails, I use Zoho Mail, then route it to Gmail for convenience.</p>

  <h2>üß∞ Productivity & Communication</h2>
  <p>I use Visual Studio Code for most of my coding.</p>
  <p>For design work and school presentations, I go with Canva.</p>
  <p>Google Suite handles schoolwork and communication.</p>
  <p>I'll use PowerPoint if I know the other person can open it.</p>

  <h2>üß† Why I Use What I Use</h2>
  <p>I'm not chasing ‚Äúclean desk‚Äù TikToks.</p>
  <p>I'm chasing tools that actually do their job, don't get in the way, and make me feel like I'm building something real.</p>
  <p>This setup is a mix of practicality, personality, and overthinking. But that's the point. It reflects how I work and what I care about.</p>

  <p>If you've got similar gear or want to build your own setup, I'll happily overanalyze it with you.</p>
