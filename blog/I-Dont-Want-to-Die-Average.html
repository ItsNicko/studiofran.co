      <h2>I Don't Want to Die Average</h2>
      <p>June 22, 2024</p>

      <p>There's this quote that floats around a lot:</p>

      <p>"A jack of all trades is a master of none."</p>

      <p>
        Usually said with a smirk. A warning.<br />
        Pick a lane. Stay in it. Don't spread yourself thin.
      </p>

      <p>But people forget the second half of the quote:</p>

      <p>"...but often times better than a master of one."</p>

      <p>
        It hits differently once you understand what it really means.<br />
        It's not about being unfocused. It's about becoming versatile.<br />
        It's about turning curiosity into capability.
      </p>

      <h2>The Strive to Learn</h2>

      <p>I don't want to just be “good enough” at one thing.</p>

      <p>
        I want to know how the front end works.<br />
        I want to understand the backend too.<br />
        I want to design, write, ship, and even fail but on my own terms, in my own hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not because I want a fancy resume.<br />
        But because I want range.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because when you know more, you can do more.<br />
        You see connections others miss.<br />
        You become the kind of person who luck sticks to not because you're lucky,<br />
        but because you've built so many surfaces for it to land on.
      </p>

      <h2>Against the Grain</h2>

      <p>Most advice tells you to specialize. To niche down. To brand yourself tightly.</p>

      <p>
        And sure mastery matters.<br />
        But I don't think mastery has to mean being one-dimensional.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'd rather be the kind of person who learns relentlessly.<br />
        Who asks “why?” when something works.<br />
        Who builds a portfolio, a server, a business, a system, and then rebuilds it better.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal isn't to be everywhere.<br />
        The goal is to be capable anywhere.
      </p>

      <h2>This Is Just the Start</h2>

      <p>
        Learning everything is impossible.<br />
        But trying to? That's where the value is.
      </p>

      <p>
        It forces you to think.<br />
        It pushes you to adapt.<br />
        And it puts you in rooms you otherwise don't belong in until you do.
      </p>

      <p>
        And when opportunity shows up disguised as a new language, a new tool, or a challenge no
        one wants to touch - you will not be guessing.
      </p>

      <p>You'll be ready.</p>

      <h2>In Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        I don't want to be the best at one thing.<br />
        I want to be dangerous at everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not because I crave attention.<br />
        But because I refuse to live a life where my potential is capped by what I never tried to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's not about being mediocre at everything.<br />
        It's about being adaptable.<br />
        Being resourceful.<br />
        Being the one who can step into any situation and figure it out.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not here to die average.<br />
        I'm here to keep learning, keep building, and stack so many skills that luck has no choice
        but to find me.
