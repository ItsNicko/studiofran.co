        <h2>Behind, but Not Outpaced</h2>
        <p>October 29, 2025</p>

        <p>
          Lately, I've been feeling behind. Not just in the "I should've studied
          for that test" kind of way, but in the <em>bigger</em> way the "what
          if I don't get into MIT" kind of way. The "what if I peaked too early
          and didn't even know it" kind of way.
        </p>

        <p>
          My GPA looks like it's been through a storm. Not terrible, but
          definitely not MIT-clean. I tell myself numbers don't define me but
          then I see people posting 4.0s and perfect scores, and suddenly I feel
          microscopic.
        </p>

        <h2>Where I Feel Ahead</h2>

        <p>
          I still feel ahead in other ways. I'm building things that actually
          matter to me like <strong>FBLACER</strong> and my documentation
          experiment <strong>learn.md</strong>. I print out code, draw what each
          function means, and rewrite it in Markdown. It's obsessive. It's also
          one of the few things that makes me feel like I'm moving forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my essay, I wrote:
          <em>"Real change comes when people can modify and build on it."</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          That's the core of everything I do. I document so others can copy,
          remix, and improve it. I want my work to start chain reactions, ideas
          that outgrow me.
        </p>

        <h2>The MIT Thing</h2>

        <p>
          I want to be around people who think like me. People who stay up
          debugging at 2 a.m. not because they have to, but because they can't
          stop. That's what MIT feels like not prestige, not a flex, but
          belonging.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I don't get in, yeah, I'll regret it. Probably for a decade. But
          maybe this version of me the one still trying, doubting, and building
          is feeling more real I dont know how to describe it.
        </p>

        <h2>Am I Enough?</h2>

        <p>
          Am I a good admit? Would I even deserve it if I got in? I don't know.
          Those questions never really leave my head.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I do know this: I like who I'm becoming.<br />
          I just hate that it took this long to start.
