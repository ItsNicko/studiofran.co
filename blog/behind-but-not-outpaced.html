  <h2>Behind, but Not Outpaced</h2>
  <p>October 29, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Lately, I’ve been feeling behind. Not just in the “I should’ve studied for that test” kind of way, but in the <em>bigger</em> way the “what if I don’t get into MIT” kind of way. The “what if I peaked too early and didn’t even know it” kind of way.
  </p>

  <p>
    My GPA looks like it’s been through a storm. Not terrible, but definitely not MIT-clean. I tell myself numbers don’t define me but then I see people posting 4.0s and perfect scores, and suddenly I feel microscopic.
  </p>

  <h2>Where I Feel Ahead</h2>

  <p>
    I still feel ahead in other ways. I’m building things that actually matter to me like <strong>FBLACER</strong> and my documentation experiment <strong>learn.md</strong>. I print out code, draw what each function means, and rewrite it in Markdown. It’s obsessive. It’s also one of the few things that makes me feel like I’m moving forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my essay, I wrote: <em>“Real change comes when people can modify and build on it.”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s the core of everything I do. I document so others can copy, remix, and improve it. I want my work to start chain reactions — ideas that outgrow me.
  </p>

  <h2>The MIT Thing</h2>

  <p>
    I want to be around people who think like me. People who stay up debugging at 2 a.m. not because they have to, but because they can’t stop. That’s what MIT feels like not prestige, not a flex, but belonging.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I don’t get in, yeah, I’ll regret it. Probably for a decade. But maybe this version of me the one still trying, doubting, and building is feeling more real I dont know how to describe it.
  </p>

  <h2>Am I Enough?</h2>

  <p>
    Am I a good admit? Would I even deserve it if I got in? I don’t know. Those questions never really leave my head.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I do know this: I like who I’m becoming.<br>
    I just hate that it took this long to start.
