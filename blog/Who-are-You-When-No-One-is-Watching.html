      <h2>Who Are You When No One Is Watching</h2>
      <p>June 24, 2024</p>

      <p>Most days start the same.<br>
      Eyes open. Head heavy. A quick glance at the phone.<br>
      And then it hits:<br>
      And then it hits:<br>
      <strong>That moment.</strong><br>
      The fork in the road.</p>

      <p>Am I going to waste today?<br>
      Or will I actually become the person I keep saying I want to be?</p>

      <p>That's the fight.<br>
      Not against the world, but against me.<br>
      The lazy, comfortable, procrastinating version of me.<br>
      The one who says, “you've done enough,” when I know I haven't.</p>

      <h2>The Fear That Follows Me</h2>
      <p>I'm scared of becoming the kind of person who only moves when someone's watching.</p>

      <p>The type who performs well when it's convenient.<br>
      Who talks big and executes small.<br>
      Who's surrounded by potential, but sits in the middle of it; wasting it.</p>

      <p>I used to be closer to that version of myself than I want to admit.</p>

      <p>Freshman and sophomore year?<br>
      I was average.<br>
      My grades, my effort, my mentality -- all of it.<br>
      I did what was required. Nothing more.<br>
      I wasn't failing, but I definitely wasn't rising.</p>

      <p>And deep down, I knew it.<br>
      Knew I wasn't trying. Knew I was making excuses.<br>
      But I stayed there.<br>
      Because average feels safe.<br>
      <p>Until it doesn't.</p>

      <h2>The Conversations That Changed Me</h2>
      <p>I didn't get out of that mindset alone.</p>

      <p>Talking with people around me convinced me.<br>
      They didn't say anything complicated.<br>
      They silently worked while I laid back.</p>

      <p>Looking at people with a differnt mindset changed the way I looked at things<br>
      "If they can work this hard why cant I?"<br>
      “Imn not going anywhere if I continue being lazy”</p>

      <p>They weren't trying to motivate me.<br>
      They were just living different. and I felt it.</p>

      <p>Ambition doesn't scream. It shows.<br>
      And when I saw it in them, I realized how far I was from mine.</p>

      <p>That was the wake-up call.</p>

      <h2>Today Is the Test</h2>
      <p>So now, every day I wake up with the same question:</p>

      <p>“Who are you when no one is watching?”</p>

      <p>Because that's the real test.<br>
      Not the exam. Not the deadline. Not the audience.<br>
      But the quiet morning. The open laptop. The decision to do the hard thing when you could do nothing.</p>

      <p>That's the version of me I'm building now.<br>
      The one who doesn't wait for pressure to perform.<br>
      The one who treats silence like a spotlight.</p>

      <h2>The People I Choose</h2>
      I'm careful<i>ish</i> with who I surround myself with now.</p>

      <p>Not because I think I'm better than anyone, but because I know how easy it is to fall back.<br>
      People without ambition will drag you down.</p>

      <p>Not always on purpose.<br>But their mindset becomes your ceiling.<br>
      And I've already lived too long under low ceilings.</p>

      <p>I want to be around people who talk about ideas, not gossip.
      <br>People who set goals, not just complain.<br>People who don't just dream, but move.</p>

      <p>Because when I'm around that energy, I rise.<br>
      I stretch.<br>
      I remember who I'm trying to become.</p>

      <h2>In the End</h2>
      <p>This isn't about perfection.<br>
      It's not about grinding 24/7 or never messing up.</p>

      <p>It's about <strong>showing up</strong> -- especially when no one's clapping.<br>
      Choosing progress when procrastination feels easier.<br>
      Doing the work that no one will see, because you'll know if you didn't.</p>

      <p>So yeah.<br>
      Some days I still slip.<br>
      But not as often.<br>
      And never for long.</p>

      <p>Because every morning is another chance to answer the same question:</p>

      <p>Who are you when no one is watching?</p>

      <p>And now -- I like my answer.</p>
