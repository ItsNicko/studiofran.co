        <h2>Why I Don't Learn Like School Taught Me</h2>
        <p><em>June 24, 2024</em></p>

        <p>
          School teaches you to follow. Memorize, regurgitate, move on. You do
          the work, pass the test, forget it next week.
        </p>

        <p>That's not learning. That's surviving.</p>

        <p>
          If I actually tried to learn the way school told me to, I'd still be
          stuck waiting for permission to start.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't learn by chapters. I don't learn for grades. I learn to build.
          I learn to move. I learn to get somewhere.
        </p>

        <h2>1. I Don't Start With Concepts. I Start With Goals.</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>In class:</strong> "Let's learn arrays, then conditionals,
          then loops..."
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>In real life:</strong> "I want to build this. What do I need
          to figure out first?"
        </p>

        <p>
          That shift saved me. I don't sit around waiting to be "ready."" I dive
          in, get stuck, and then I learn what actually matters.
        </p>

        <h2>2. AI and Google Are Tools. Not Cheats.</h2>
        <p>
          In school, asking for help is "cheating." In the real world, it's how
          you grow 10x faster.
        </p>

        <p>
          I use ChatGPT to build study sets <i>in seconds</i>. I dig through old
          forums. I copy code, break it, glue it. If I don't know something, I
          find out.
        </p>

        <p>
          No shame in that. Pretending you know everything is way slower than
          just asking.
        </p>

        <h2>3. I Don't Memorize. I Rep.</h2>
        <p>
          Studying for a test is just prepping for forgetfulness. Instead, I do
          reps.
        </p>

        <p>
          I retype things. I break code and fix it. I rebuild projects from
          scratch. I don't flashcard theory; I loop reality. Over and over.
        </p>

        <p>Muscle memory &gt; mental notes.</p>

        <h2>4. I Learn in Public. Even If It's Messy.</h2>
        <p>
          I post the process. Even if it's not perfect. Even if it's cringe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because that pressure? It makes you sharper. You build different when
          people are watching. Even if they don't say a word.
        </p>

        <h2>5. I Follow Curiosity. Not Curriculum.</h2>
        <p>
          I didn't fall in love with machine learning because someone assigned
          it. I got obsessed because I saw what it could do.
        </p>

        <p>
          School tries to make you care after the fact. I follow the spark and
          figure it out on the way.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Word</h2>
        <p>
          Look; I'm not anti-school. But if I relied on school to teach me
          everything I care about? I'd be average.
        </p>

        <p>
          Real learning starts when you decide to stop waiting. You build. You
          fail. You dig. You climb. And you don't stop when the bell rings.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's how I learn. That's how I grow. And that's how I'm going to
          win.
