  <h2>Why I Don't Learn Like School Taught Me</h2>
  <p><em>June 24, 2024</em></p>

  <p>School teaches you to follow.  
  Memorize, regurgitate, move on.  
  You do the work, pass the test, forget it next week.</p>

  <p>That's not learning. That's surviving.</p>

  <p>If I actually tried to learn the way school told me to, I'd still be stuck waiting for permission to start.</p>

  <p>I don't learn by chapters.  
  I don't learn for grades.  
  I learn to build. I learn to move. I learn to get somewhere.</p>

  <h2>1. I Don't Start With Concepts. I Start With Goals.</h2>
  <p><strong>In class:</strong>  
  “Let's learn arrays, then conditionals, then loops…”</p>

  <p><strong>In real life:</strong>  
  “I want to build this. What do I need to figure out first?”</p>

  <p>That shift saved me.  
  I don't sit around waiting to be “ready.”  
  I dive in, get stuck, and then I learn what actually matters.</p>

  <h2>2. AI and Google Are Tools. Not Cheats.</h2>
  <p>In school, asking for help is “cheating.”  
  In the real world, it's how you grow 10x faster.</p>

  <p>I use ChatGPT to build study sets <i>in seconds</i>. I dig through old forums.  
  I copy code, break it, rebuild it.  
  If I don't know something, I find out.</p>

  <p>No shame in that.  
  Pretending you know everything is way slower than just asking.</p>

  <h2>3. I Don't Memorize. I Rep.</h2>
  <p>Studying for a test is just prepping for forgetfulness.  
  Instead, I do reps.</p>

  <p>I retype things. I break code and fix it.  
  I rebuild projects from scratch.  
  I don't flashcard theory; I loop reality. Over and over.</p>

  <p>Muscle memory &gt; mental notes.</p>

  <h2>4. I Learn in Public. Even If It's Messy.</h2>
  <p>I post the process. Even if it's not perfect.  
  Even if it's cringe.</p>

  <p>Because that pressure? It makes you sharper.  
  You build different when people are watching.  
  Even if they don't say a word.</p>

  <h2>5. I Follow Curiosity. Not Curriculum.</h2>
  <p>I didn't fall in love with machine learning because someone assigned it.  
  I got obsessed because I saw what it could do.</p>

  <p>School tries to make you care after the fact.  
  I follow the spark and figure it out on the way.</p>

  <h2>Final Word</h2>
  <p>Look; I'm not anti-school.  
  But if I relied on school to teach me everything I care about?  
  I'd be average.</p>

  <p>Real learning starts when you decide to stop waiting.  
  You build. You fail. You dig. You climb.  
  And you don't stop when the bell rings.</p>

  <p>That's how I learn.  
  That's how I grow.  
  And that's how I'm going to win.</p>
